# GAV RL

Welcome to GAV, a GPL rendition of the popular Arcade Volleyball.

In addition to the original game, GAV RL implements an AI agent based on Deep
Q-Learning. It uses
[stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) as RL
framework and includes a neural network visualization tool for live demos.
